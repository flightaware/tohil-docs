Installing Tohil
######################

Below are instructions for building and installing Tohil
from source code on Linux, the Mac, and FreeBSD.

The Tohil developers expect to make Tohil available as
pip-installable binary packages for at least Intel/AMD64
and Arm procesors for Linux, the Mac, and FreeBSD in
the not too distant future.
In the meantime, you will need to build from source.
