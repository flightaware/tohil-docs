*****************
Dealing with Bugs
*****************

Python is a mature programming language which has established a reputation for
stability, but Tohil is new and somewhat immature.

In order to become highly reliable, the Tohil developers would like to
know of any deficiencies you find in it.

It can be sometimes faster to fix bugs yourself and contribute patches to
Tohil. This can be done through https://github.com/flightaware/tohil.

Documentation bugs
==================

If you find a bug in this documentation or would like to propose an improvement,
please submit a bug report on aforelinked github site.  If you
have a suggestion on how to fix it, include that as well.


Using the Tohil issue tracker
==============================

Please use Tohil's issue tracker at https://github.com/flightaware/tohil/issues.

Getting started contributing to Tohil yourself
===============================================

Beyond just reporting bugs that you find, you are also welcome to submit
patches to fix them.  We will review pull requests and work with you to
get yours accepted, or something satisfactory, as long as what you are
trying to do is reasonably aligned with how we think tohil should work.

You can always fork it if you want to go off on your own direction.
